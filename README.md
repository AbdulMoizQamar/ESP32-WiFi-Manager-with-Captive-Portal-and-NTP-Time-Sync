# ESP32-WiFi-Manager-with-Captive-Portal-and-NTP-Time-Sync
This project allows the ESP32 to automatically connect to previously saved WiFi credentials stored in EEPROM. If the connection fails (e.g., network unavailable or credentials changed), the ESP32 sets up a WiFi Access Point (AP) with a captive portal where users can scan available networks and enter new WiFi credentials through a web interface.
